Have you ever encountered this scenario - You intend to invest in a stock X (currently trading at 100$), if it drops to 90$. Sometimes, the stock does drop to 90$ and you buy it or the stock goes way beyond, to 120$ and you are upset about it. What if I told you, that you can be paid, for waiting for the stock to drop to 90$, before buying them?

I have faced this situation myself numerous times and have been frustrated many a times about missed opportunities. However, I recently learned about a trading instrument that helps in this scenario precisely - selling cash covered puts.

When the topic of options comes up, people often find it complicated or too risky. I used to think the same. I mostly knew about buying options. With selling options, I vaguely remembered that there was an unlimited downside risk due to which I never bothered looking into it. But a friend of mine told me about selling puts and that's when I realized that they were great for the kind of investments I was doing.

# Example

Let me use Microsoft (MSFT) stock as an example in the below discussion. As of today (April 2nd, 2020), MSFT is trading at 155$. Remember these two parameters. 

Points to remember:
* Currently MSFT @ 155$ on 04/02/2020
* 1 contract = 100 units of a stock

Tom goes out in the open market and tells everyone:

> I will purchase 100 stocks of MSFT at 150$/stock any time between now and April 30th (04/30/2020). Once I sign this deal with someone, I won't go back on my word. Also, because I am committing to buying 100 units @ 150$/unit, I will set aside 150$ * 100 = 15,000$ aside, in a common eschrow."

Let's try to understand the dynamics of what Tom just said. When I say dynamics, I mean the following
* What is in it for Tom?
* What is in it for someone who transacts with Tom?
* What is Tom's risk?

At first, it seems like no one would be interested in Tom's deal. After all, the stock is trading at 5$ above the price he is willing to buy. But then, note that Tom said "anytime". So what if the stock falls to 100$? Tom will be forced to buy the stock at 150$ and face a loss of 50$ on each stock! This is the risk that Tom is taking on.

What about the other person? In our initial setting, Tom is offering this deal without expecting anything in return. So if it was me, I would just take the deal and make money, if the stock does fall to below 150$, I make money. If it doesn't, I just won't sell Tom stocks at 150$! Simple.

However, I am not the only one to spot this. 100 other people want to take the deal as well! Now Tom thinks, wait, because there are so many people interested, I will sign the contract, but you have to pay me 10$. Now things get interesting. Maybe 100 people aren't interested anymore, but just 30. But that's still a lot of people. How much can Tom increase the price, so that there will be reasonable amount of people left - the right amount of demand for the supply. 

This price, is the price of the contract.
